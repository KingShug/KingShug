Hi my name is Sean but my friends call me Shug
Im a complete Novice to programming but im working on building up my skills and knowledge to grow and learn in this exciting and magical world.

  I have been building and useing my own PCs since I was 6 years old ever since I borrowed/(stole Im not sure if we ever returned them srry) a 
bunch of books from the local library and started collecting components from pretty much everywhere. (This was the 90s there were "broken" PCs 
everywhere, screens flickering "eh toss it out and get a new one" LOL) From there every time someone in the family had a broken pc I would 
offer to "recycle" it for them only to bring it home and frankenstine togather a "NEW" rig. Eventually once I started working I was able to 
actually buy my components and hobble togather my first custom build. It was..... OK (I was still poor) but the first time it post was an incredeble fealing.

  I have always loved building computers but alot of self-doubt in my self and namely my intelligence stopped me from ever trying to well do anything.
  I would tell myself "oh don't do that youll just suck" or "Why try if your just going to fail" <--(that ones a classic). It took along time to break myself
  of that toxic mindset and during that time I lost alot namely I lost track of my childhood dream.

        I want to use computers to make something magical. 

    I want to learn as much as I can to be a real programmer and to make magic, because lets be real thats what all this is programmers use magic words to 
    make magic happen on the screen, even if we know how it happens dosn't nake it any less magical and wonderfull if anything the more I learn the more im filled 
    with wonder. We live in a magical age and this field is evolving every day and I can't wait to join it!!!!

      Im so glad after all these years im finally finally putting my doubts aside and journying forth on this adventure ive got along way to go to catch up but,
      look out im chasing after you full sprint.

      
    With love,
    Shug
